# Simple Python Calculator
This is a basic calculator script written in Python. The program takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and performs the corresponding mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or percentage). The result is then displayed to the user.

Features:
Addition: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first and shows the result.
Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers and outputs the result.
Division: Divides the first number by the second and displays the result (handles float division).
Percentage Calculation: Calculates the percentage of the two numbers.
Input Validation: Handles invalid operator input by displaying an error message.
How It Works:
The user is prompted to input two numbers.
The user enters a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /, %).
Based on the operator, the corresponding operation is performed:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
% for percentage calculation
If an invalid operator is entered, the program prints "Invalid Input."
The result of the operation is printed along with a "THANK YOU" message.
Example Usage:
plaintext
Copy code
_______CALCULATOR________

Enter number: 10
Enter number: 5
Enter operator: +
Addition:  15
....THANK YOU....
Technologies Used:
Python: The script is written in Python and uses basic control structures like if-elif-else to handle user input and perform operations.
Setup Instructions:
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Run the script (calculator.py) in a Python environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input numbers and choose an operator.
